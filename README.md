A Udacity Front End Dev project to help learn JavaScript

**Getting started**
First, clone or download the repo to your local machine. Once downloaded, launch the index.html file in your preferred browser.

**The Goal of the game is to navigate to the water at the top of the screen without hitting enemy bugs.**

**Description:**

The player must navigate up/down/left/right to reach the water (at the top of the game board) without colliding with enemy bugs.

**To Play:**

Move the arrow keys up/down/left/right to navigate your player avatar. If you hit an enemy bug, you will lose a "star rating". 
Three collisions with enemy bugs results in loosing the game with an optional restart prompt.
Three times reaching water without collision result in winning the game with an optional restart prompt.
