**Frogger Classic Arcade Game** 
A Udacity Front End Dev project to help learn JavaScript.

**Description:**

The player (avatar) must navigate up/down/left/right to reach the water (at the top of the game board) without colliding with enemy bugs.

**To Play:**

Move the arrow keys up/down/left/right to navigate your player avatar. If you hit an enemy bug, you will lose a "star rating". 
Three collisions with enemy bugs results in loosing the game with an optional restart prompt.
Three times reaching water without collision result in winning the game with an optional restart prompt.
