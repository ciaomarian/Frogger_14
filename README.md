# Frogger Classic Arcade Game
## A Udacity Front End Dev project to help learn JavaScript

### Getting started:
First, clone or download the repo to your local machine. Once downloaded, launch the index.html file in your preferred browser.

**The Goal of the game is to navigate to the water (at the top of the screen) 3 times without hitting enemy bugs.**
**If you hit enemy bugs 3 times in sucession, you will lose, with an option to restart the game.**

**Description:**

The player must navigate up/down/left/right to reach the water (at the top of the game board) without colliding with enemy bugs.

**To Play:**

Move the arrow keys up/down/left/right to navigate your player avatar. If you hit an enemy bug, you will lose a "star rating". 
Three collisions with enemy bugs results in loosing the game (and all stars) with an optional restart prompt.
Three times reaching water without collision results in winning the game, maintaining your 3 star rating, with an optional game restart prompt.
